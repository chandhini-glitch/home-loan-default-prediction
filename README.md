# Home Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the probability of home loan default using machine learning techniques. 
The objective is to help financial institutions assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions.

The project was developed as part of an academic research and applied analytics initiative, with emphasis on practical business interpretation rather than just model accuracy.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Loan defaults pose a significant financial risk to banks and lending institutions. 
By analyzing historical borrower data, this project aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to loan default behavior.

---

## 🧠 Approach & Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

- Data understanding and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and preprocessing  
- Model building using machine learning algorithms  
- Model evaluation and comparison  

---

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Income, loan amount, credit history, and employment status played a major role in predicting defaults.
- Tree-based models captured non-linear relationships better than linear models.
- Business interpretability was prioritized alongside predictive performance.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
